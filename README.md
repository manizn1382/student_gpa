# student_gpa


this is my project to build model to predict students_gpa base on some features(e.g absences,studytTime).i'm using decision tree for my model and some probability concept like correlation to extract main features and box plot to detect outliers,fill "nan" values on table and finally predict student_gpa on test dataset.

in "Student_Gpa.ipynb" you can see some description and markdown in farsi.
